It was so good for three reasons – firstly, it tasted amazing. Secondly, it can be used in a million different ways – pizza sauce, spaghetti bolognese, lasagne… (and this recipe actually makes enough for <i>at least</i> two meals). Thirdly, it only took about five minutes of effort, because the slow cooker did all the rest. Winning! (are people still saying that?)</p><div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4y8aolX_95o/UWrcPCeIwrI/AAAAAAAAC8U/E-5gwgpvF-o/s1600/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+2.jpg" title="Slow cooker tomato sauce recipe" target="_blank"><div><div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Slow%20cooker%20tomato%20sauce%20-%20Amuse%20Your%20Bouche.resources/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+2.jpg" height="640" width="623"/></div></div> </a></div><p>When I dragged myself off the sofa at about midnight after an evening in front of the telly with a beer (or two), the last thing I felt like doing was getting back in the kitchen to fill up the slow cooker. However, about four minutes later it was all done, and I wondered why I’d been so reluctant. I was even more pleased the next morning when my house smelled like Italy and this rich tomato sauce was bubbling away.</p><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KofzXIffKlE/UWrcQCz7K3I/AAAAAAAAC8k/IXGsxwnohoQ/s1600/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+8.jpg" title="Slow cooker tomato sauce recipe" target="_blank"><div><div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Slow%20cooker%20tomato%20sauce%20-%20Amuse%20Your%20Bouche.resources/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+8.jpg" height="426" width="640"/></div></div> </a></div><p>The slow cooker is <i>perfect</i> for making tomato sauce. It’s one of those things that tastes better the longer you let it simmer. I’ll admit, I sometimes resort to using a jar of the premade stuff because I just can’t face spending my entire afternoon simmering a pan of sauce for long enough to get it thick rich – and it’s never as good if you take too many shortcuts. This version is the best of both worlds – it’s been cooked long and slow, so the tomatoes become sweet and flavourful, but it’s also barely any more effort than opening a jar. It suits me perfectly.</p><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y0hFhAnDet8/UWrcPKB1QSI/AAAAAAAAC8o/xunNN96UcMs/s1600/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+7.jpg" title="Slow cooker tomato sauce recipe" target="_blank"><div><div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Slow%20cooker%20tomato%20sauce%20-%20Amuse%20Your%20Bouche.resources/Slow+cooker+tomato+sauce+recipe+7.jpg" height="474" width="640"/></div></div> </a></div><div><div>Slow cooker tomato sauce</div><div><div> Author:&nbsp;&nbsp;Becca @ Amuse Your Bouche (adapted from My Whole Food Life)</div></div><div><div>Ingredients</div><ul><li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li><li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li><li>2tbsp tomato purée</li><li>1 onion, roughly diced</li><li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>3tbsp fresh basil, roughly chopped</li><li>½tsp mixed dried herbs</li><li>Black pepper</li></ul></div><div><div>Instructions</div><ol><li>Add all ingredients to the slow cooker, and cook on low for around 8 hours. Using an immersion blender, blend the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency (mine was fairly smooth but still had some texture). I wanted mine to thicken up a little so I then removed the lid and cooked on high for a further 1½ hours, but feel free to skip this step if your sauce is a nice consistency.</li></ol></div></div><p>For My Whole Food Life’s original recipe, see <a href="http://mywholefoodlife.com/2013/04/09/easy-crock-pot-tomato-sauce/" target="_blank">here </a>.</p></div></div></div></div><br/></body></html>
