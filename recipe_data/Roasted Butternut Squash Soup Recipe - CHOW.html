                      <div><p>Having to peel and dice an oddly shaped, tough-skinned butternut squash for soup can be a turnoff, so we simply cut it in half and roast it in the oven. That way, its flavors concentrate without hours of simmering, and the roasted flesh is easily scraped out of the skin. The squash is then quickly simmered with sautéed onion, sage, and tart apple, and blended with a bit of cream. To add a fancy touch for a dinner party or holiday celebration, garnish with <a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/30066-savory-pumpkin-seed-and-rye-granola" target="_blank">savory pumpkin seed granola </a>.</p>

<p>If you’re making the soup in advance, cool it to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze it for up to 1 month.</p>

                      <div>INGREDIENTS</div>
                      <div>
                        <ul><li>4 pounds whole butternut squash (about 2 medium), halved lengthwise and seeds removed</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/4 stick)</li>
<li>1 medium Granny Smith apple (about 8 ounces)</li>
<li>1/2 medium yellow onion</li>
<li>8 fresh sage leaves</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed</li>
<li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
                      </div>

                  <div>INSTRUCTIONS</div>
                  <div>
                    <ol>	<li>Heat the oven to 425°F and arrange a rack in the middle.</li>	<li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the squash pieces cut-side up on the baking sheet. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and brush all of it over the tops and insides of the squash halves (alternatively, you can rub it on evenly with your fingers). Season generously with salt and pepper. Roast until knife tender, about 50 minutes to 1 hour.</li>	<li>Meanwhile, peel, core, and cut the apple into medium dice. Cut the onion into medium dice. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the apple, onion, and sage, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.</li>	<li>When the squash is ready, set the baking sheet on a wire rack until the squash is cool enough to handle. Using a large spoon, scoop the flesh into the saucepan with the sautéed apples and onions; discard the skins.</li>	<li>Add the broth, water, and measured salt and pepper, stir to combine, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up any large pieces of squash, until the flavors meld, about 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cream.</li>	<li>Using a blender, purée the soup in batches until smooth, removing the small cap (the pour lid) from the blender lid and covering the space with a kitchen towel (this allows steam to escape and prevents the blender lid from popping off). Alternatively, use an immersion blender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve garnished with the pumpkin seeds, if using.</li></ol>

      I made this soup tonight and it turned out really good but I must say, the toppings I put on it made it more interesting. I made some changes and used 1 small butternut squash, a golden acorn squash and 1/2 of a Kabocha squash to equal 4 lbs. that the recipe calls for. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and roasted garlic cloves (Although I over roasted them by 10 minutes)  I added a little stevia to give it a touch more sweetness; My topping idea was to add crumbled nitrate free bacon and it tasted really good with squash; cubed avocado and sour cream. very thick and a nice change~

      Jejheard50, I think you are correct.  Sariahzar must have oversalted.  I use very little salt, usually only salting at the serving stage.  This soup is great on cold, wintery days and absolutely looks like the illustration.  But I don't do nuts, just a couple of slices of avacado and a little sour cream on the top.

      Anyone offering a recipe for a squash-based soup that does not recommend baking the squash probably has not even tried their own recipe. So points for that recommendation. Also, the type of onion used can have a large impact on the flavor of the soup. So at least you mentioned a yellow onion (I prefer a sweet onion, as it takes a little edge off the onion after-taste, some might think this oversweetens the soup). If you plan on storing the soup, you may want to add the cream only when serving, rather than mixing when making the soup. It will last longer in the fridge without the cream. There are a lot spice options, so experiment. I like adding a dash of nutmeg, esp during the holiday season.

      I love this recipe. I followed most of the suggests below. I roasted the squash, apples, onion, sage, and 8 whole garlic cloves. Added the spices and replaced the cream for coconut milk. It was delicious. I will be serving this as my first course for Christmas dinner. Thanks everyone and happy holidays.

      This is a very good basic recipe! As evidenced by the 40+ reviews, there are any number of ways to tailor this soup for individual tastes. In my case (this time), I added 1.5 tsp. of sweet curry powder and 1/8 tsp. cayenne and substituted canned coconut milk for the heavy cream. It’s quite tasty, and should make an excellent accompaniment to our cumin and paprika-seasoned turkey.

      AMAZING!!!  I created a healthier version by using coconut oil instead of butter and more chicken broth instead of the heavy creme.  I think it tastes great without the creme in it.  Might add almond milk to individual bowls for an option.  I also added carrots and celery with the onions/apples part and turned out great.  Going to become a fall staple for me.

      Very tasty.  I dried sage since I was out of fresh.  All veggie broth and 1 cup of apple juice for more flavor, which made it a bit sweet.  A couple dashes of hot sauce took care of that.  

Served with diced sausage and garlic bread.

      I think this is the best butternut squash soup I've ever had.  We used a sweetmeat squash in place of the 2nd butternut (because it was what we had) and roasted it plain - no butter or salt.  It was perfect.

      Loved this recipe! I used cut up butternut squash from trader joes and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Used regular chicken broth but cut back on the added salt. A very smooth and comforting soup for this time of year.

      I had gone to Panera Bread a couple weeks ago &amp; ordered the Autumn Squash Soup.  It was fantastic.  I wanted to make it at home so started searching &amp; came across this recipe &amp; made it.  It was WONDERFUL, much better than Panera Bread's.  It's a keeper for sure.  Although it's good as it is, I will play around with it a bit, add some garlic &amp; spices like cinnamon &amp; nutmeg.  Maybe another apple.

      Supreme base; just added a dash of nutmeg, a dash of ginger and a big dash of cinnamon.  Also subbed some apple cider (I used Martinelli's!) for 1 cup of the water to add a little flavor.  A dollop of sour cream on top to serve and possibly some chili flakes or a dash of hot sauce..........YUMMY!  Goes great with a grilled cheese &amp; ham sandwich!

      I also changed this around. Delicious! I used precut Butternut Cubes from Trader Joes and roasted with the apples with peel on and the onion and fresh sage. I used MELT which is like butter but made from Coconuts and I threw in some whole cloves of garlic all in one roasting pan at 425 for 20 minutes ( Since no skin on Squash, cooked faster ) I then threw it all into my vitamix with the liquid and used Mexican creme instead of whole cream and I topped it with a sage sausage that I ground up and cooked and the pumpkin seeds. YUM!!

      This may seriously be one of the best things I've ever made. Delish and simple! I made half the recipe and added fresh thyme and garlic since I didn't have sage. The cream was such a great addition I had to add the entire one third cup. Yum city!!

      This is a DELICIOUS recipe, probably one of the best I've ever had. I love butternut squash soup and was looking for a great recipe. I added garlic and ginger puree, 2 carrots and substituted the sage for bay leaves. As an alternative to cream, I used 2% milk. I also added some ground cumin, curry powder and chili flakes. AMAZING!

      I made this for dinner tonight - it was DEEELICIOUS! I made a few minor revisions, substituted the butter with EVOO, and used 2 cups of Edward &amp; Son's No-chicken broth + 2 cups of water and 1 cup of almond milk, eliminating the heavy cream.  Later, as it thickened, I stirred in a little more almond milk to keep it creamy.  It was amazing!  Loved the diced apple, very flavorful!  Packing it in my lunch tomorrow - already looking forward to lunch!  :)

      Can't rave enough about this soup! I roast the squash, onions &amp; apple to amp up flavor. Add a dash of garlic and  a pinch of red pepper flakes OR Frank's Red Hot for a touch of warmth.  Top with a few drops of EVOO &amp; serve with a crusty roll. Magnificient!

      I made a vegan version of this soup. I subbed coconut oil for butter (the roasted squash was so sweet and delicious) and almond milk for cream. I also used an unpeeled fuji apple as that's what I had on hand. This soup tasted amazing with my homegrown butternut squash and fresh sage from the garden. WOW!

      This was amazing. I did make alterations to accommodate what I had on hand.  I used a small apple of unknown variety from my yard and a half of a Honey Crisp.I didn't have any sage leaves so I substituted Bell's Seasoning, starting with 1/2 t and adjusted up. I didn't have a chance to puree it! Husband highjacked a mug just roughly mashed and declared it perfect. High praise from him,typically not a soup eater. Living in NH ingredients are local and abundant so I'm looking forward to trying different variations.

      First time making it and love it. My 11 year old pretty much made it on her own. Couple changes, 2 apples, skim instead of cream and added red pepper and curry. Amazing!!

      Me and my family absolutely love this soup. I have prepared it two different way and each was a phenomenal favor. I have my 3rd batch simmering in the crock pot as we speak. Can't wait to dive into it.

      Roasting the squash is a great idea. I made this today but omitted the apple and sage in lieu of dried guajillo and chipotle chiles and thyme. The result was smoky and spicy and everything you could want on a cool fall evening.

      This is a great recipe - but like everything else I ALWAYS change it just a little to my taste. I used a dash of nutmeg instead of the sage leaves ( I don't like sage) and I also added a chopped up very sweet white carrot along with the apple. This soup is amazing - I could eat it every day and my whole family loves it.

      THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The only change I made was using 3/4 teaspoon dried sage instead of fresh sage leaves (because I did not have any). I also added a big dash of cinnamon at the end. Lastly, I swirled in a dollop of goat cheese to each serving. Best butternut squash recipe around.

      I've never had butternut squash soup before and I don't know why! The only change I did was to roast the onion and apple along with the squash.  I didn't peel the apple and blended everything, sage leaves included, with my immersion blender.  This was just delicious.

      Yeah! Used Greek yogurt instead of cream, added a little cayenne. Second day of fall in the Pacific Northwest. Gentle rain, chill in the air, soup in the belly. Paired with Ninkasi Total Domination IPA and Portland City Sour Sourdough. GF melted, aces.

      Great recipe! I substituted whole Lactaid milk for the cream and a little sour cream swirled in as a garnish with a top garnish layer of finely minced yellow summer squash and a fresh nasturtium flower in each bowl. Was a wonderful first course to a dinner of ravioli, spanish rice and fresh green beans.

      Not exactly a springtime menu but we really enjoyed this with Rueben Sandwiches tonight and will definitely be making again.  I didn't have a really tart apple which I think would have made it even better so will make sure I use that next time.

      It is simple. I'm waiting for the squash to bake. I roasted the seeds to enjoy as a snack later. Now that I'm tasting it, I find its flavourful. I added a spoonful of brown sugar and had the soup with a melted gouda sausage sandwich. The sweet of the soup combined with the salt of the cheese sausage combination is wonderful together. Your taste buds will come alive.

      Good recipe, I used coconut oil instead of butter for flavor.  Also didn't use fresh sage, instead I used 1 tsp dried sage, 1/2 tsp marjoram, 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/4 tsp cardamom and 5-6 pieces chopped candied ginger.
This is an excellent soup, I think a dab of creme fresh or sour cream would be better than the seeds to keep the creamy texture consistent. YUM!!

      I bought the largest butternut squashes at the store. It took more time than noted which oven temps vary. 

After scraping the squash out I didn't come up with 4 pounds. It was more like a little over 3 but I went ahead and made it to the scope of the ingredients. 

I salted the squash but I cut down on the amount of salt used in the soup and added in a salt substituent (Mural of Flavor by Penzeys). I was making this for my grandma who has to watch her sodium. 

Grandma approved and loved the soup and so did I. This is a keeper.
