<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">Take 4 to 5 pounds of broccoli (I just got two large bunches), cut into florets (but relatively big ones.) Here’s the key that she doesn’t mention in the recipe: dry them THOROUGHLY. That is, if you wash them. I saw an episode of Julia Child cooking with Jacques Pepin once when Pepin revealed he doesn’t wash a chicken before putting it in a hot oven: “The heat kills all the germs,” he said in his French accent. “If bacteria could survive that oven, it deserves to kill me.” By that logic, then, I didn’t wash my broccoli; I wanted it to get crispy and brown. If you’re nervous, though, just wash and dry it obsessively.</p>
<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">Now, it’s easy. Put the broccoli on a cookie sheet. Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper. (She says 5 Tbs olive oil, 1 1/2 tsps kosher salt, 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper, but I just eyeballed it.) Now add 4 garlic cloves that are peeled and sliced and toss them in too.</p>

<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">Roast in the oven 20 to 25 minutes, until “crisp-tender and the tips of some of the florets are browned.”</p>
<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">I shook the pan around a bit as it went, but not sure that’s necessary.</p>
<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">When it’s done, take it out of the oven–and here’s where it gets really good–zest a lemon over the broccoli, squeeze the lemon juice over the broccoli, add 1.5 Tbs more olive oil, 3 Tbs toasted pine nuts (I left those out), and 1/3 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. She also has you add 2 Tbs julienned fresh basil, but I left that out too.</p>

<p style="background-repeat: initial initial;line-height:22px;font-size:14px;">You won’t miss it: the magic combo of the crispy broccoli, the garlic, the lemon and the cheese will make this the best broccoli of your life. I guarantee it; you will go ga-ga over it. I’m so ga-ga over it that I would seriously consider a trip right now to the store just so I could make this for lunch. Broccoli for lunch? After trying this, you’ll never want to eat anything else for breakfast, lunch or dinner ever again.</p><div style="clear: both"/></div></body></html>
