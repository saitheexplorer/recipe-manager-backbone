I don’t like using my slow cooker for everything, but for a few things it works complete <i>magic</i> (<a href="http://budgetbytes.com/2011/08/not-refried-beans/" target="_blank">beans </a> and <a href="http://budgetbytes.com/2011/10/coffee-rubbed-pork-roast/" target="_blank">meat </a>, for instance). The magical long, slow cooking process caramelizes the sugars in the tomatoes and creates a depth of flavor that can’t be matched!</p><p>Plus, what more could you ask for than to just throw some ingredients in a pot, forget about it for 8 hours, and then come back to a rich, delicious red sauce?</p><p>The price of this recipe will depend greatly on what you’re able to get your canned tomatoes for. When I made the <a href="http://budgetbytes.com/2009/12/homemade-marinara/" target="_blank">original (non-slow cooker) version </a> of this recipe a couple of years ago, I paid almost half what I paid for canned tomatoes today. So, the price this time around was about the same as the store bought jarred equivalent, but hey, I made it myself and it’s so much tastier!</p><p>Since this recipe makes quite a bit, I pour the extra into freezer bags and freeze it for up to about 4 months. Make sure you cool it down in the refrigerator before pouring into freezer bags, though ;)</p><h2>Slow Cooker Marinara</h2><p/><div><div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="slow%20cooker%20marinara%20-%20Budget%20Bytes.resources/Slow+Cooker+Pasta+Sauce+jar.jpg" height="480" width="640"/></div></div><p/><div><div>slow cooker marinara</div><div><div>Total Cost: $5.15</div><div>Cost Per Serving: $0.40</div><div>Serves: 6.5 cups</div><div><div>Ingredients</div><ul><li>2 (28 oz.) cans crushed tomatoes $3.47</li><li>1 (6 oz.) can tomato paste $0.56</li><li>1 medium yellow onion $0.54</li><li>½ Tbsp minced garlic $0.10</li><li>2 whole bay leaves $0.10</li><li>1 Tbsp dried basil $0.15</li><li>½ Tbsp dried oregano $0.07</li><li>1 Tbsp brown sugar $0.02</li><li>1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar $0.09</li><li>to taste salt &amp; pepper $0.05</li></ul><div><div>Instructions</div><ol><li>Cut the onion into a small dice and mince the garlic (or use pre-minced garlic from a jar). Place both in the slow cooker. Also add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, bay leaves, basil, oregano, and freshly cracked pepper. Stir well to combine.
