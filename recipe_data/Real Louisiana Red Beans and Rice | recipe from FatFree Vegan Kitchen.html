It’s <a href="http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/2007/02/happy-mardi-gras.html" target="_blank">Mardi Gras </a> time again! I’ve been craving red beans and rice ever since last weekend, when my husband and daughter left me alone for some much needed quiet time while they went back to New Orleans for the first parades. They came home with loads of beads, doubloons, stuffed animals, and MORE beads, and I was left longing for my favorite childhood food, Red Beans and Rice.<p/>
<p>Growing up in southeast Louisiana, I ate a lot of red beans and rice; in fact, Mondays were red beans and rice days in the school cafeteria, and while other kids complained about them and made fun of their lowly appearance, I secretly loved red beans. After all, the cafeteria ladies made <em>real</em> Louisiana red beans, highly seasoned and so well-cooked that it was hard to tell where the beans ended and the sauce began. My Alabama-born mother, on the other hand, cooked something she called red beans but wasn’t. Oh, there were beans and they were red, each one fully intact and separate from its fellow beans in a bland sauce. This was not real Louisiana red beans and rice.</p>
<p>When I grew up and got my own kitchen, I was determined to cook my red beans the way they were supposed to be cooked: all mushy and full of spice. The first recipe I ever tried was from Paul Prudhomme’s <em>Louisiana Kitchen</em>. It called for six large ham hocks and a pound of andouille sausage and wound up taking two Dutch ovens to hold it all. I’d never cooked a ham hock before, and it was impossible to find andouille sausage in southern Illinois, where I was in grad school, but I made do with Polish sausage. The recipe turned out knock-your-contacts-out spicy, but I loved it. It was real, melt in your mouth red beans.</p>
<p>That was many years and a couple of lifetimes ago. Over the years I adapted the recipe, first to reduce the amount of meat (I had no love for the ham hocks) and finally to eliminate it entirely. In the process I lightened up the recipe, made it easier to follow, and made it all fit into one pot.</p>

<h2>Real Louisiana Red Beans and Rice (Sans Animaux)</h2>
<p><em>Start off lightly with the red and black pepper and Tabasco sauce; you can always add more at the end.</em></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<div>
<h4>Instructions</h4>

</div>
<div>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>If your beans are old, they may never disintegrate, or at least not in time for dinner. What you have to do is take out a bunch of them, mash them up well, and add them back into the pot (or use a hand blender right in the pot). Then proceed as though they had fallen apart on their own. I won’t tell anyone if you don’t!</p>

<p>Preparation time: 15 minute(s)  | Cooking time: 2 hour(s) 10 minute(s) </p>
<p>Number of servings (yield): 8</p>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<p>Throughout this whole procedure, you should have a nice glass of wine. The spirit of Mardi Gras will not be stopped! Throw me something, Mister! <em>Et laissez les bon temps rouler!</em>  </p>

<p>    I grew up in New Orleans. I loved the cafeteria red beans and rice, too! You’re right, only Camellia brand will do. Last time I went back I shipped several bags of beans home. I’ve never been able to find them in Northern California.</p>

<p>    Sounds absolutely delicious, I’d request the beans, only that would require you sending them to the Netherlands (which may be asking too much of your generosity) . As a very recent convert I only just discovered your wonderful website and blog. Many thanks for the effort</p>

<p>    Hi Molly! Nice to meet a fellow ex-Louisianian! I grew up in Hammond, but my husband’s from New Orleans. We live only about 3 hours away now, but there are still things that we have to “import” every time we go home.</p>
<p>    Hi Stevo-r, and welcome to…I assume you’re a convert to veganism because I can’t remember preaching any religion here! LOL I’m happy to have a reader in the Netherlands. I do want to clarify, though, that the offer is for BEADS (plastic necklaces that they throw at Mardi Gras parades) and not BEANS, which would make a very messy package! <div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Real%20Louisiana%20Red%20Beans%20and%20Rice%20%7C%20recipe%20from%20FatFree%20Vegan%20Kitchen.resources/resource_3.png" height="15" width="15"/></div> </p>

<p>    OOh, I’ve been looking for something Mardi Gras-ish to serve Tuedsay night. I used to do a king cake, but we just don’t eat that way anymore. This is perfect. Thank you.</p>
<p>    Do you think they would cook in the crock-pot? I’m thinking if they need to fall apart I might have to cook them 20-24 hrs. rather than the 8-12 that I cook my beans normally in the CP.</p>

Blogger SusanV said…</p>
<p>    Hi Sue! I think you’re right that they’d probably need to cook a long time in the crock pot. You could probably get around this by pre-cooking the beans on the stove for about an hour. Let me know if you try this. I’ve always wanted to but haven’t gotten around to it. (I have cooked them in the pressure cooker, and that was MUCH faster.)</p>
<p>    Also, if you’re interested in Louisiana recipes, here are a couple more possibilies:<br/>
    Chickpea Gumbo–you can find it both at Fatfree Vegan Recipes or (the newest adaptation) at Veggie Venture.</p>
<p>    And I’ve got a great Tofu Jambalaya–just leave out the oil to make it low-fat.</p>

<p>    I just made this last night and it came out great! I was wondering whether it could be made successfully in a pressure cooker. How would you modify the recipe for pressure cooking?</p>

Blogger SusanV said…</p>
<p>    Toadfood (cute name, btw), I’ve made them in the pressure cooker before, but I’m sorry to say that I didn’t write down the directions. I probably cooked them with the same amounts of ingredients for about 10 minutes under high pressure and them cooked them uncovered for a while. But I remember having to add more and more seasonings to get them to taste right, and I didn’t write those amounts down. I find that spices “disappear” easily during pressure cooking, so I just add more to taste. I hope this helps you some.</p>

<p>    Wow I feel so fortunate to have found your blog! What a gift you’re giving by sharing your love of cooking, thank you! I was a pretty accomplished cook a few lifetimes ago before I went vegetarian, now I am learning how to cook all over again. (I’ve been veg for almost 10 years but it’s been on &amp; off due to pregnancy cravings.) I cannot wait to try your red beans &amp; rice. The best rice &amp; beans I ever had was in Down Neck Newark, NJ, made by Portugese, unfortunately they do use meat, so I’ve been really wanting to find a suitable replacement that didn’t require meat. I make a decent black beans &amp; rice but I love red beans too and really looking forward to making yours. Again, thank you for offering to share your knowledge of food like this, you are gifted and a gift!</p>

<p>    Maybe this is a stupid question, but can you substitute canned beans for dry ones? All the recipes I’ve seen for red beans and rice call for the dry ones, but the canned ones seem more conventient (aka faster!).</p>

Blogger SusanV said…</p>
<p>    Christiana, I’ve never found a canned bean that really tastes like the dried ones. They’re a lot firmer and mealier, somehow. I’m sorry to disappoint you, but if you want anything close to authentic red beans and rice, you have to start with dry. Of course, there are canned versions–Blue Runner makes one–that are ready to go, just heat and eat. I’m not sure if you can get them outside of Louisiana, though.</p>

<p>    I’m making this recipe right now! I grew up in Alexandria, LA and now I live in Lexington, KY, where good (vegan) food is hard to find, especially Louisiana food. I’ve been craving traditional red beans and rice, without the meat, and I hope this fills my craving! I tried making etoufee vegan the other day, and it turned out OK, but wasn’t very traditional tasting <div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Real%20Louisiana%20Red%20Beans%20and%20Rice%20%7C%20recipe%20from%20FatFree%20Vegan%20Kitchen.resources/resource_1.png" height="15" width="15"/></div> </p>

<p>    I like the touch about drinking a little wine while making the recipe. on problem being that i didn’t have any wine.. but i did have beer! great recipe, i’ve made it many times. a few touches that i like to add to it are soy crumble and, try it before you talk, sugar. soy crumble reminds me of when my grandma used to make it when i was a kid with ground beef, but this way it’s still vegetarian at the very least. she used to also add sugar to sweeten it up just enough to add another wonderful flavor. advice: 1/2-1 lb soy crumble, sugar to taste. enjoy and thanks again!</p>

<p>    i literally just finished doing the dishes for these beans and rice. delicious! i made a few changes. my sweetie and i, being pacific northwesterners, are not as accustomed to spicy foods as folks from the south. so i didn’t use quite as many peppers. also, the store did not have liquid smoke (!) but they did have a product called “fakin’ bacon”, a very good tempeh bacon sub that provided all the smokey taste necessary!</p>

<p>    I actually made this dish in the slow cooker yesterday and my family loved it! I had the leftovers for breakfast, yum! Anyway, I soaked the beans overnight, rinsed them, covered them with fresh water, and boiled them for about 30 min. Then, I added them to all the other ingredients in my slow cooker and cooked them for about 9 hours on high. Thanks for the great recipe! <div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Real%20Louisiana%20Red%20Beans%20and%20Rice%20%7C%20recipe%20from%20FatFree%20Vegan%20Kitchen.resources/resource_3.png" height="15" width="15"/></div> </p>

<p>    Hello! Thank you for this wonderful web site and recipe! I am not an experienced cook but am trying! I made this yesterday and the beans were delicious, but I ended up with way too much liquid. It didn’t look like your picture (which shows the recipe nice and thick). I even took some of the beans out at the end and blended them in a blender to help thicken, but it wasn’t enough. What did I do wrong? We soaked the beans overnight, put only 2 inches of water over the beans, and cooked them 3.5 hours (at the high end of simmer). I did cover the pot with a lid while it was simmering. Was that a mistake? Thank you for any help!</p>

Blogger SusanV said…</p>
<p>    Hi Jennifer–I think that covering the pot kept a lot of the liquid from evaporating, so next time (if you want to make it again!) either add less water or leave the pot uncovered. I hope you were able to boil away some of the excess liquid after the beans were cooked!</p>

<p>    I have been looking for a kidney bean recipe all over the web and stumbled over this one. It is very tasty. I usually soak my beans over 24 – 36 hours and it reduces the cooking time a lot. I would avoid using a slow cooker on any kidney bean recipe as the beans contain a substance that can be toxic if not cooked on very high heat for at least 10 min. A slow cooker doesn’t get that hot. I had to ad much more oregano and red pepper and I also chopped up a tomato and added it at the end. Very very good recipe. thanks a lot <div style="display:inline-block;"><img src="Real%20Louisiana%20Red%20Beans%20and%20Rice%20%7C%20recipe%20from%20FatFree%20Vegan%20Kitchen.resources/resource_2.png" height="15" width="15"/></div> </p>

<p>    I found you on a simple google search for vegan red beans and rice and I’m so glad i did. I used can beans because i was short on time, and these were the best beans i’ve had in my 20 years of vegetarianism. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!</p>
